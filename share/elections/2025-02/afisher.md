# Alex Fisher (@alexjfisher)

My name is Alex Fisher. I've been a Linux system administrator, network, and DevOps engineer for over 20 years. I first contributed to Vox Pupuli in 2015 and was re-elected to the PMC last year. Originally working for myself as a freelance Puppet engineer, I later took a full-time job during COVID.

Luckily, I still get to do plenty of Puppet workâ€”even if it's sometimes on older operating systems. I know I'm not alone in this, and I believe this experience enables me to provide value to the community by representing those in similar situations.

Despite what the current owners might think, the community has always been Puppet's biggest asset. The warmth it has shown to its users and contributors is the reason so many have devoted their time to the project and why it's still the best configuration management tool available.

I'm really excited about OpenVox and the future. Projects that once felt abandoned are now getting the love and interest they deserve. So much is coming, and I'd love to stay involved with Vox and help foster growth in the community.
