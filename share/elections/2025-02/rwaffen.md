## About me

My Name is Robert Waffen. I'm a german Automation Engineer @ [betadots](https://github.com/betadots). I often code for customers but also do some codeing for myself. Next to Puppet I also like to write some Ruby code. In my free time I like to play pc games, watch every scifi available to me, or read manags and comics.

## My experience with Puppet

I first came into contact with puppet in 2011. Then i was only a user of pre-written code I had to deploy. But as often: the code was failing or did things it shouldn't do. So I had to understand "this puppet". Next stage after using, was debugging code from other people. After that I started to write my first own code and helped with some github code for an OpenNebula module. And so I did more and more: first PRs on other modules, do testing, setup puppetservers, upgrade whole infrastuctures from one version to another, deep dive in performance and so on ...

## My experience with Vox Pupuli

Right after starting to opensource code I found out that there are a lot of modules on github. Modules which are not from Puppet Inc. itself.
I also found out that this is not some code dump and never updated again, no it was a living and healthy community. Over the years i did some small PRs here and there. I'm not the biggest developer, but i like to plan and sort things. I like to organize and help other people.

In the last time I saw that more and more people handover their modules to Vox Pupuli. It is an important thing to have all this modules on more or less the same standrads. To have a place to get all the puppet devs together. To have Vox Pupuli itself. And I want help to support this.
