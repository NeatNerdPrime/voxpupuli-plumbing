# Sebastian Rakel (Spritzgebaeck)

## About me
My name is Sebastian Rakel, I'm a german cloud engineer/devops dude in a small company named [ServiceERP](https://service-erp.de) and love to automate things. 
In my free time I'm chairman of a hackerspace (Forschung und Technik e.V.), husband of a beautiful wife and father of an awesome daughter.

I was a PMC Member for the last two years, my work was mostly to review things and do some work on tools/pages. 

## My life with puppet/openvox

Since 2016/2017 I'm using puppet, joined #voxpupuli in 2017.
My private setup and my company setup are built on puppet. 
I wrote some modules (mostly not open source) and reviewed a ton of PRs in Vox Pupuli repositories.
I'm developer of the openvoxview project (project like puppetboard) (will be released in the two weeks to public)

## My life with Vox Pupuli

In addition to reviewing PRs, working on openvoxview, give my two cents to discussions
