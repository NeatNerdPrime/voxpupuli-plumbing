# Ben Ford aka binford2k

My name is Gene Liverman and I would like to nominate Ben Ford for the Vox Pupuli PMC. He has been in this community longer than I can remember and has always played a very active role. In a past life, he was in charge of community at Puppet Labs / Puppet / Puppet by Perforce and, as a result, couldn't really be on the PMC due to a conflict of interest... that is no longer the case and I think it is high time for him to formally be in a leadership role within Vox Pupuli.
