# Tim Meusel

Hi!

My name is Tim Meusel, also known as bastelfreak.
I am a Vox Pupuli collaborator since 2014 and a PMC member since the beginning.
Puppet is my preferred automation toolkit since 2012.
In the past decade I contributed to all major modules and tools within the Puppet ecosystem.
I had the pleasure to get to know many other contributors and companies that use Vox Pupuli projects and I want to continue this journey.

Currently I put most of my effort into our modulesync setup and the various pipelines.

In my past year as a PMC member, I invested a lot of time into getting more sponsors for Vox Pupuli and configuring their different servers for our pipelines.

My goal for the next term is to improve the overall developer experience by speeding up pipelines, making them more stable and making them easier to use.
I also give talks on a regular basis about Vox Pupuli at different conferences, and I want to continue this as well.
