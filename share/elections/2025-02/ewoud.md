# Ewoud Kohl van Wijngaarden

My name is Ewoud Kohl van Wijngaarden, more commonly known as ekohl on GitHub.
I've been around in the Vox Pupuli community since 2016 and a PMC member for the past 2 years.
I was going to say not a lot has changed since my 2023 & 2024 nominations but then we forget the OpenVox situation.
In my next term OpenVox and the increased demands it puts on Vox Pupuli will have my focus.
