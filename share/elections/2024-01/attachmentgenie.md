## About me

Hi, my name is Bram Vogelaar and i would like to put myself forward as a PMC member.

Vox Pupuli is both a great resource and stable factor in the wider puppet ecosystem
without which puppet as a whole would not be the great tool and resource it is today.
Simply put it allows us to stand on the shoulders of those that came before us and or
are still trying to make puppet the cfgmgmt tool of choice.

Due to changing interest and employment my attention for puppet has been a bit in the
background but my love was never gone. But i notice that the burden is carried by a
precious few.

Now that i have a renewed focus on puppet i would like to do my bit for the ecosystem
and Vox Pupuli more specifically

## My life with puppet

I have been using puppet since 0.24 and have setup and managed more puppet setups that i care to remember.

I have been part of the wider puppet community since about 2014, I maintain several modules on the forge that
i either enherited or created. Over the years i have spread the gospel at conferences like cfgmgmtcamp and puppetize digital.

I also have some vagrant starter projects (e.g vagrant-puppetmaster) that have been a great basis for
several of my projects and as a training vehicle for new people starting out with puppet

## My life with Vox Pupuli

Of late my work with Vox has mostly been focusesed on HashiCorp related modules and drive by comments on modules that
i happen to have been working.
