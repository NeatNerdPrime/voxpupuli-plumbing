# VoxPupuli 2016 First Elections

This page contains the metadata about the first VoxPupuli Elections.

# Scope

Vote for the initial 5 members of the PMC

# Election Officer

The Election Officer should be appointed by the PMC. As there is none, the
following people propose to run the first elections, and will step down from
this role just after the election:

* Julien Pivotto (roidelapluie@inuits.eu)
  * Accepting candidatures
  * Communication before the election
* Daniele Sluijters
  * Voting process
  * Encouraging people to vote
  * Communication for the election
  * Announcement of the results

According to our rules, the Election Officers can not run in the Election.

The Election officer will also be in charge of the communication during that
period, as there is no Communication Officer.

# Dates

* How to become a candidate: Open an issue or submit a Pull Request to be added
  to the list below before *September 17 2016 23:59 UTC*.
* How to vote: details still need some work. Votes will begin on *September 18
  2016 12:00UTC* end on *September 28 2016 12:00UTC*.


# Candidates

Each candidate can provide:

- Their name and Github account name
- A link to their github account
- a page (a Markdown page in this repo and on the website)
- a second arbitrary link. That second link can point to their website, twitter
  account, a specific blog post... But in any cases the content
  reflected in that link MUST be related directly to the candidate and respect
  the [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://voxpupuli.org/coc/).
