# Election Officer

The Election Officer should be appointed by the PMC. As there is none, the
following people propose to run the first elections, and will step down from
this role just after the election:

* Julien Pivotto (roidelapluie@inuits.eu)
  * Accepting candidatures
  * Communication before the election
* Daniele Sluijters
  * Voting process
  * Encouraging people to vote
  * Communication for the election
  * Announcement of the results

According to our rules, the Election Officers can not run in the Election.

The Election officer will also be in charge of the communication during that
period, as there is no Communication Officer.
