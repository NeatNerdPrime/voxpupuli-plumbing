# Alex Fisher

My name is Alex Fisher.  I'm a Linux system administrator, network and DevOps engineer with over 10 years experience.
I've been a Vox Pupuli Contributor since 2015.  I work for myself helping various companies with their puppet and foreman adoption.
I think Vox Pupuli is a fantastic organisation!  It's always been very friendly and welcoming to its users and contributors.
The community is amazing.  So many people giving up hours of their own time to help each other.
This community spirit and warmth makes working with puppet so enjoyable and is one of the organisation's biggest assets.
Long may this continue!

Having worked with Puppet pretty much full time for 4 years, I've made a wide range of contributions to various modules and related projects.

A few random examples.

* [puppet-extlib](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-extlib/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aalexjfisher) Converting all the functions to the new API (with extlib namespace).
* [puppet-appd\_db\_agent](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-appd_db_agent) A new module for installing and configuring the [AppDynamics Database Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Database+Visibility)
* [Supporting Puppet 6](https://github.com/voxpupuli/plumbing/issues/172) An issue I opened to track how we could start supporting Puppet 6 at VP.
* [puppet-nrpe](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nrpe/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+author%3Aalexjfisher) Migration and modernisation of an abandoned module to Vox Pupuli.
* [sensson-powerdns](https://github.com/sensson/puppet-powerdns/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Aalexjfisher) Added postgreSQL support, puppet 4 data types, etc.
* [puppet-zabbix](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-zabbix/pull/318) A reasonable example of puppet type unit testing
* [katello-pulp](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulp/pull/284) Don't use type defaults for pulp\_rpmrepo properties
* [katello-pulp](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulp/pull/231) Added a new type.

I'm immensely proud to have been a member of the PMC in 2018 and would love to continue into 2019.

Most people will probably know me from the #voxpupuli IRC channel and Slack. Vote for me!  I'll be at [Config Management Camp Gent](cfgmgmtcamp.eu) in a couple of months time.  I don't actually have green hair!  See you there, (hopefully as a newly re-elected PMC member)!
