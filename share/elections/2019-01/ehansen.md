# Erik Hansen

I'm a Senior Support Engineer at Puppet where I've worked for the last 3+ years.

I'm obviously a big fan of Puppet, Vox Pupuli and our awesome community.

In terms of module development, here are a few things I've been working on recently:
 - A module for collecting and visualizing Puppet metrics with grafana (thanks puppet-grafana!) [puppetlabs-puppet_metrics_dashboard][pd]
 - A module that block fact resolution for "legacy" facts. [suckatrash-legacy_fact_blocker][fb]

I'll add a bit more to this in a few days, but I wanted to get this last-minute submission in.
