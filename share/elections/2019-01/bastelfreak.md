# Tim Meusel

Hi!

My name is Tim Meusel, also known as bastelfreak. I am a Vox Pupuli
collaborator since 2014 and one a PMC member since the beginning. Puppet is my
preferred automation toolkit since 2012. Currently I put most of my effort into
our modulesync Setup, to provide a unified codestyle and up2date testmatrix to
our modules. Next to that I try to release our modules on a regular basis.
Currently I am one of the top contributors to Vox Pupuli. Conferences are fun,
so I try to regulary speak about Vox Pupuli (you can find a collection of my
talks [here][talk]). In my spare time I like to complain about old software and
do barbecues. You can find me almost 24/7 in our IRC channel and from time to
time on conferences.

A few of my Puppet related projects:
- Enhancing our [zabbix module][zb] to support more operating systems and better test coverage
- [Adding Arch Linux support][al] to several of our modules
- Making our tests more beautiful by using [solid RuboCop settings][rb]
- [Blogging][bl] about Puppet and the community around it
- Managing pypuppetdb, puppetdb and puppetboard [packages for Arch Linux][aur]
- Supporting Puppet and mcollective on Arch Linux
- Migrating our modules to Puppet4 only, later on added Puppet 5 and Puppet 6 support
- Development of a [demo control repo][demo] to collect best practices and to onboard newcomers to Puppet

I invest a huge amount of time into Vox Pupuli and would love to continue this with official tasks. I want to put my focus on the following two tasks if elected:
- Proper and continuous release management for all modules
- Represent Vox Pupuli on conferences
