# David Hollinger

My name is David Hollinger. I've been a Vox Pupuli Contributor since late 2016. I'm an Infrastructure Engineer at Flywheel working on Ruby, Kuberenetes, and Cloud. In this role, I've pushed to use and contribute to as many upstream Puppet Modules and tools as possible. In my spare time, I love to play board/video games, hang out with my 2 little boys, and am a huge American College Football fan. You can find my in our IRC channel during most of the day.

Puppet projects:

* Creator and maintainer of the Vox Pupuli [autofs module][ad].
* Creator and maintainer of the new Vox Pupuli [puppetwebhook module][pw].
* Help to Port the Webhook script from the [r10k module][rd] in its own Ruby gem, [puppet webhook][pd].
* Adding, improving, cleaning up tests and templates for the Vox Pupuli [rsyslog module][sd].
* Resumed development and maintenance on the [puppetdb ruby client][pdb].
* Started [Blogging][bl] earlier this year on Puppet, Ruby, and Rails.
* Created an autosign ruby application to automate Puppet Certifcate signing and plan to create an opensource version soon.
* Created a simple External Node Classifier retrieves node classes from an Enterprise CMDB and plan to create an open source version under Vox Pupuli this year.

I spend a large portion of time, even at work, to Vox Pupuli and would like to make that more of an official capacity of mine. What I'd like to focus on if elected:

- Automating more of our release and documentation processes.
- Implement Puppet Strings docs on more modules.
- Utilize Modulesync for Vox Pupuli gems.
- Represent Vox Pupuli at conferences.
- Put a focus on not forgetting the lesser used/development Vox Pupuli projects.
