Hi, my name is Nate McCurdy. I'm throwing my name in the hat because I figured it was time I officially join the community that I've been a part of for 4 years. I'm happy to help, and very much in favor of improving the experiences of people using Puppet.

Here's a little about me:

* I've been a career sysadmin, consultant, and generally friendly dude.
* I've been using puppet since 2014.
* Worked for Puppet, Inc. (then Puppet Labs) as a Principal Professional Services Engineer for 3+ years.
* Currently working for [Open Infrasatructure Services][ois] alongside [other longtime][jeff] [Puppet users][gary].
* I wrote some modules to help solve problems in the field:
  * [nate/purge_node][purge]
  * [nate/windows_account_names][windows]
  * [nate/yumrepos_fact][yumrepos]
  * [natemccurdy/pe_install_ps1][pe_install]
* Contributed to many of the current Puppet Inc, best-practice guidelines, Puppet Enterprise modules, and upgrade tooling.
* I'm almost always on Slack and am happy to answer questions and share my experiences.
* For some strage reason, I think refactoring Puppet code is fun and I enjoy it.
* Even weirder, I genuinely like helping people solve problems. What's wrong with me?
* Spaces. 2 of 'em.
* vim

Thanks for reading!
