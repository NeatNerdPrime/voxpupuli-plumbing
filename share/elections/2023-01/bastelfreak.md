# Tim Meusel

*« Deeply involved into voxpupuli »*

Hi,

I would like to propose Tim Meusel as PMC member.

Tim acts as PMC member for quire some time, He is always looking for improvements,
supports new members and permanently improves the pipeline and Puppet ecosystem.

Most modules live by Tim taking care on PRs and making suggestions.
He also supports non voxpupuli modules and has a tremendous list of open issues
at Puppet JIRA.

Tim likes talking about the community and puppet.
His recent talk was held at CfgMgmtCamp.
- [Ghent 2023][CfgMgmtCamp] about Open Source, Community and Voxpupuli
- [Los Angeles - SCALe20x 2023][scale20x] about Open Source, Community and Voxpupuli

His deep involvement makes him an invaluable member of the community.

```puppet

    motivated => true,
}
```
