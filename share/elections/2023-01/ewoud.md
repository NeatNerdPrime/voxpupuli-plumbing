# Ewoud Kohl van Wijngaarden

I, [Tim Meusel](https://github.com/bastelfreak), nominate Ewoud as a PMC
candidate.

Ewoud is awesome! That's it. That should be enough as an introduction.

He is around in the Vox Pupuli community since 2016-02-22. I'm doing Puppet
stuff since almost 10 years and he's the person I ask when I am stuck. Ewoud
is a recognized expert in the Foreman community and in Vox Pupuli. His PR
reviews are so helpful because he always finds stuff that could be improved and
teaches newcomers about it. He was the driving force behind our Travis-CI to
GitHub Actions migration. He refactored our whole CI setup to make it:
* more efficient
* faster
* easier to extend for future Operating systems, Ruby versions and Puppet versions
* [reduce boilerplate code in modulesync\_config][msync] so we need to run msync less often!

Ewoud also did [a presentation][talks] at CfgMgmtCamp about the CI setup.

I would love to see Ewoud in the PMC because he deserves it. Ewoud, and the work he delivers,
is amazing.
