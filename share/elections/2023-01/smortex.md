# Romain Tartière

About me:

* My name is Romain Tartière, aka @smortex;
* I am a Free Software mercenary / a Hacker;
* For a living, I brutalize computers until they do what they are supposed to do, the way they are supposed to do it;
* I live in French Polynesia.

My experience with Puppet:

* I can't tell exactly when I started to use Puppet, but for sure I had been there for some time when someone decided that the version after 0.25 would be 2.6 (in 2010);
* According to the first commit of my git repository, I started to use a control-repo in 2016, imported my existing configuration and after a few month most of the code was reworked to rely on the _Roles & Profiles_ pattern;
* I wrote a lot of modules before the Puppet Forge came to life and we could share them with other users.  I phased-out most of them over the years (replacing most of them with modules from the Puppet Forge), but I still have a few areas where I use my legacy modules;
* As a FreeBSD user and developer, when Puppet 5 was at the corner, I realized that the various components of the Puppet Platform (Facter, Puppet, PuppetDB) where maintained by a bunch of different people.  We created a FreeBSD _puppet@_ team to take care of these ports;
* I did some extensive C++ work to bring Facter 3 (aka cfacter) on par with the legacy ruby Facter 2 (aka rfacter) on FreeBSD; and a few wears later some extensive Ruby work to bring Facter 4 (which was in Ruby again) on par with Facter 3;
* Nowadays this FreeBSD maintainer work continue but is straightforward most of the time (update version numbers, build packages, run system-wide acceptance tests).

My experience with Vox Pupuli:

* The first time I put a Vox Pupuli module in my control repo was in July 2017;
* … but before that r10k was already cloning modules directly from git repositories of the voxpupuli organization since June 2016;
* My first PR for Vox Pupuli was probably in 2018 to make `modulesync_config` more portable on FreeBSD;
* In 2021 I got invited to join the Vox Pupuli organization \o/;
* Since I am a Vox Pupuli collaborator, I opened PR, wrote reviews, commented on changes, suggested improvements, etc. almost every day;
* I am currently maintaining or helping maintaining two organizations modules using the Vox Pupuli tooling.

Why I am interested in joining the Project Management Committee:

Vox Pupuli modules are important tools of my day to day work. As a collaborator I can help keep this tools on track and follow what is going on.  But beside this technical side, the Vox Pupuli organization is composed of awesome people, and I would be pleased to help there too if I can!
