# Sebastian Rakel

I, Tim Meusel (bastelfreak), want to nominate Sebastian Rakel (Spritzgebaeck) as
PMC candidate. Spritzgebaeck joined the community as a user and later as
collaborator in 2017:

```
irc.freenode.#voxpupuli.weechatlog:2017-04-19 11:42:45    -->     Spritzgebaeck (~Spritzgeb@srakel01.rackmonkey.de) has joined #voxpupuli
irc.freenode.#voxpupuli.weechatlog:2017-04-19 17:51:24    Spritzgebaeck   bastelfreak: !!!!
```

probably because I broke something.

Spritzgebaeck does an awesome job since years to review pull requests in the
Puppet ecosystem. He is a good developer who's always happy to answer my stupid
questions. Besides that he's not afraid to talk at conferences or meetups. He
is also quite active in the Arch Linux community (and leads the karma system
in the German Arch Linux IRC channel, which is often used to reflect useful
answers to questions).

I think Spritzgebaeck would be a good candidate for the project management
committee because he is active on IRC, a helpful person and a longtime Puppet
user and Vox Pupuli contributor.
