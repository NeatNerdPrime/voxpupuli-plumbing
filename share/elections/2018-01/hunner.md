# Hunter (Hunner) Haugen

My name is Hunter Haugen and I am addicted to irc^W^W^W have been a long-time fan and participating member of Vox Pupuli as well as a vocal lobbyist for VP inside Puppet. I am the charter member of the "modules team" at Puppet itself and have been there for 7 years (there were 19 employees when I started). I have commits in practically every single module under the [github.com/puppetlabs][gh] namespace as well as many other modules across the internet. I haven't administered any actual infrastructure in years, so I'm always looking for subject matter experts who can give advice on how to make the modules better!

Some things:

* Created the VP [hiera module][hi].
* You can [pry][pry] into puppet manifests.
* My [dotfiles][dot].
* Here is a [puppet compiler][pc] written in Haskell.
* Here is the best [lambda calculus][lc] introduction around.
* Learn to [negotiate your salary][neg].
* Be more productive with [Pomodoro][po].
* See random [mainframes][ma] around the internet.
* Play an MtG-like game with a [regular deck][cut] (circa 1975).
