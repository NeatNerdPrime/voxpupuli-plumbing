# Alex Fisher

My name is Alex Fisher.  I'm a Linux system administrator, network and DevOps engineer with over 10 years experience.
I've been a Vox Pupuli Contributor since 2015.  I work for myself helping various companies with their puppet and foreman adoption.
I think Vox Pupuli is a fantastic organisation!  It's always been very friendly and welcoming to its users and contributors.
The community is amazing.  So many people giving up hours of their own time to help each other.
This community spirit and warmth makes working with puppet so enjoyable and is one of the organisation's biggest assets.
Long may this continue!

Having worked with Puppet pretty much full time for 3 years, I've made a wide range of contributions to various modules and related projects.

Some random PR examples.

* puppet-zabbix [Improve zabbix\_tempate type](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-zabbix/pull/318) A reasonable example of puppet type unit testing
* puppet\_webhook [Switch to using rack-bodyparser](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet_webhook/pull/36) A bit of Ruby refactoring
* katello-pulp [Don't use type defaults for pulp_rpmrepo properties](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulp/pull/284) (Puppet type/providers are hard)
* puppet-nginx [Add add_header parameter to location](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nginx/pull/1160) A simple change with rspec-puppet tests.
* f5-f5 [Set more core facts](https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-puppet/pull/10) Make the F5 puppet module compatible with The Foreman
* yano3-cerebro [Various improvements](https://github.com/yano3/puppet-cerebro/pull/14)
* katello-pulp [Add pulp_rpmbind type](https://github.com/theforeman/puppet-pulp/pull/231)
* puppet-squid [Add extra_config_section defined type](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-squid/pull/17)
* theforeman/smart-proxy [Use RRData option when deleting DNS records](https://github.com/theforeman/smart-proxy/commit/67c1cc836418583d85b7782b1ceef3ac554e0abd)
* biemond/orawls [Add new 'removeinfectedconnections' property to wls_datasource](https://github.com/biemond/biemond-orawls/pull/308)

Sorry for the above mess.  Whilst I consider myself skilled in Puppet and its ecosystem, and really look forward to continuing my work with VP, I suck at writing CVs etc!
Most people will probably know me from the #voxpupuli IRC channel. Vote for me!  I'll be at [Config Management Camp Gent](cfgmgmtcamp.eu) in a few weeks time.  I don't actually have green hair!  See you there, (hopefully as a newly elected PMC member)!
