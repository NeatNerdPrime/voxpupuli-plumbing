# Eric "eputnam" Putnam 

Hi,

I'm Eric, a member of the Puppet Modules team in Portland, OR. I'm always interested in ways we can interact with the community and make life easier for Puppet users. It's important to me that if people want to use Puppet, they feel supported in doing so. VoxPupuli seems like a great place for community and Puppet to meet.

Some personal highlights since last elections:
- option to define custom sections in the [github-changelog-generator][gcg]
- postgresql_conn_validator as a custom type/provider in [puppetlabs-postgresql][pgsql]
- built a module for i18n testing at Puppet [eputnam-i18ndemo][i18n]
- spoke at PuppetConf 2017 on i18n/l10n for modules

Current/future wishlist:
- Find new ways to integrate VoxPupuli's and Puppet's release processes
- Externalize Puppet module CI
- Roll out puppet-strings 2.0.0 and get Puppet to actually start using it :)

```puppet
pmc_member {'eputnam':
    ensure    => present,
    motivated => true,
}
```
