# Tim Meusel

Hi!

My name is Tim Meusel, also known as bastelfreak. I am a Vox Pupuli collaborator since 2014 and one of the current PMC members. Puppet is my preferred automation toolkit since 2012. Currently I put most of my effort into our modulesync Setup, and try to release our modules on a regular basis. Currently I am one of the top contributors to Vox Pupuli. In my spare time I like to complain about old software and do barbecues. You can find me almost 24/7 in our IRC channel and from time to time on conferences.

A few of my Puppet related projects:
- Enhancing our [zabbix module][zb] to support more operating systems and better test coverage
- [Adding Arch Linux support][al] to several of our modules
- Making our tests more beautiful by using [solid RuboCop settings][rb]
- [Blogging][bl] about Puppet and the community around it
- Managing pypuppetdb, puppetdb and puppetboard [packages for Arch Linux][aur]
- Migrating our modules to Puppet4 only, later on added Puppet 5 support

I invest a huge amount of time into Vox Pupuli and would love to continue this with official tasks. I want to put my focus on the following two tasks if elected:
- Proper and continuous release management for all modules
- Represent Vox Pupuli on conferences
