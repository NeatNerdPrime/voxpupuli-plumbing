## About me
Hi everyone! My name is Nick and I'm the CTO and co-founder (along with @binford2k) of Overlook InfraTech.
Prior to this, I was a principal engineer at Puppet/Perforce for 6 years, working on all manner of things around Puppet Enterprise
and was part of the Open Source Stewards group. As part of this work, I was a strong advocate for making as many things public
and open as possible and working hand-in-hand with the community, including advocating for making build and test pipelines public.

## My OpenVox life
Shortly after I left Perforce to start Overlook InfraTech with @binford2k, Perforce took Puppet closed-source. The Puppet ecosystem that so many
of us depend on was at risk of disappearing, so I immediately set to work building a community fork. Within the first week, I had the
rebuild of Puppet packages ready, using a containerized build strategy that I had already been experimenting with, and that effort grew into OpenVox.
I built the initial implementation of the packaging, CI pipelines, code signing, S3 infrastructure, and package repositories, and brought the project
to Vox Pupuli so it could be owned and governed by the community rather than any single company.

Since then, I've continued to lead the technical architecture and implementation across the OpenVox stack while a
growing group of contributors has been doing fantastic work across the project. It's been genuinely exciting to watch this
community come together and I'm very proud to be a part of it!

## Why I'd like to be on PMC
Vox Pupuli has a stellar group of leaders, and up to now I've been heads-down on the technical side getting OpenVox off the ground.
That's been the right focus during these early days, but as the project has grown significantly over the past year with more and
more contributors, I think the PMC would benefit from also having someone with deep architectural knowledge of the full OpenVox
stack.

In practice, that means helping evaluate technical proposals with full context of how the pieces fit together, helping prioritize
work so that contributors, many of whom generously volunteer their limited free time, can be as effective as possible, and making
sure the project stays technically coherent as it scales. I want to help people do their best work in a project that's always
responsive to the people building it.

Beyond the technical side, I care deeply about the health of this community. Open infrastructure belongs to the people who use and
build it. That's exactly what OpenVox is, a community project, built and governed by the community. I'd like to help
steward that on the PMC, both the engineering direction and the culture of openness and collaboration that makes this community
worth being part of.

Thanks very much for your consideration!
