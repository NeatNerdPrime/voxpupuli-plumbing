# Kenyon Ralph

I (bastelfreak) would like to nominate kenyon.
He is around in the community since ages and I had the pleasure to meet him in Gent this year.
Kenyon is always friendly and open-minded.
He is always available for reviews, has a great knowledge about the Vox Pupuli tooling and the ecosystem as a whole, and he doesn't hesitate to dive into unknown areas.

Because of that I would like to see him on the PMC.
