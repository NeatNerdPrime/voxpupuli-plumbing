# Tim Meusel

Hi!

My name is Tim Meusel, also known as bastelfreak.
I am a Vox Pupuli collaborator since 2014 and I applied for many many PMCs in the past years.

Puppet, now OpenVox, is my preferred automation toolkit since 2012.
In the past decade I contributed to all major modules and tools within the ecosystem.
I had the pleasure to get to know many other contributors and companies that use Vox Pupuli projects and I want to continue this journey.

In my past year as a PMC member, I reviewed the Perforce EULAs, organized VoxConf 2025 and shaped the OpenVoxProject GitHub organisation.

Improved developer experience was one of my main goal in the past and it still is for the next PMC term.
We have great potential in automated end to end testing in OpenVox builds and more automated changes in our modules (e.g. metadata.json updates, releases).
I want to implement those things.
I want contributors to receive feedback faster, to spend less time on maintenance tasks, and to have a CI matrix that increases our confidence when merging changes.
