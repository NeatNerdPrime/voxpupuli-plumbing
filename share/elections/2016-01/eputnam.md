# Eric "eputnam" Putnam 


*« n00bsauce »*

Hi,

I'm Eric, one of the newest members of the Puppet Modules team in Portland, OR. This is my first engineering gig and I'm eager to get involved in the community. 
I have a short resume comprising of equal parts desktop support and QA but I'm looking forward to adding more and more Developer to it.

I maintain a website or two for friends on the side:
- [Brilliant Body PDX][bbpdx]
- [Bells and Hunters][bnh]

If you play the [Kittens](http://www.bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens), I've started a new repo...
- [eputnam/kittens][kittens]

I've already made contributions to several modules: 
- [puppetlabs-inifile][inifile]
- [puppetlabs-vcsrepo][vcsrepo]
- [puppetlabs-stdlib][stdlib]

I'm painfully aware of my junior status but think that I could be a valuable member of this team if elected!

```puppet
pmc_member {
  'eputnam':
    ensure    => present,
    motivated => true,
}
```
