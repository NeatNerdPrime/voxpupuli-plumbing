# Bren Briggs

Hello to all my Vox Pupuli friends!

You know me on GitHub as bbriggs and irc as fraq or maybe as "that person who approves all bastelfreak's modulesync PRs." I've been a puppet user since 2013 when I dicovered it was the perfect tool for building and rebuilding my Hadoop cluster over and over again. Since then, I've been hooked! I started using a 2.x version and am now in the midst of a complete 4.x overhaul for my own environment at work, so I've also been around long enough to see the change the language has undergone. 

I spend most of my working time in the operational trenches of Puppet, wrangling nasty applications into usable roles and profiles, teaching Git workflow and Puppet classes to coworkers, and generally spreading the good word of devops within my company by being the champion for change. Good network operations is a passion of mine and I love being able to show people not only how Puppet works, but how it works _for them in their specific situation._ 

In addition to my VP contributions, here are some other projects I've been involved in:

- Former DevOps/Development Workflow maintainer for [Oppia][oppia]
- Founder of the [Rapid Translation Toolkit][rtt] and its first tool, [Linguiflow][lf], for assisting field translators with their linguistic work (still in development. Contributions welcome.)
- The driving force behind [Wycliffe USA's][wusa] open source work, driving our Docker, Puppet, and GitHub accounts and activity.
- The director of challenge development for [Indigitous #Hack][hack], a 50-city mass collaboration involving dozens of organizations and thousands of students
- The author of the very silly, not-serious-at-all-and-currently-broken [puppet-catfacts][cf] (sorry)
- The (reluctant) author of the very serious [wusa-sftp-jail][sftp] (not sorry)
- After I pestered him with a flurry of patches and issues, rnelson0 foolishly gave me a commit bit to [local_user][lu], so I guess I help maintain that too.
- Founder and maintainer of [Legobot][lb], an framework for a highly modular IRC chatbot that is turning into a muti-protocol platform we are targeting for chatops use.

So as you can see, while I spend the vast majority of my time drooling over videos of meat on grills with bastelfreak, I have my fingers in a variety of things while working in the operational trenches and advocating for all-around devops *culture* in addition to the technology.


### My promise to you

VP is already an awesome community, and I can only hope to improve what good things we already have by bringing my experience in operations and as an advoate for open source. If elected, I vow to work hard to make VP a welcoming place to all comers, continue to improve our maintenance process, and help ensure we maintain high quality on our modules by seeking Puppet Approved status when possible and ensuring no module goes untouched for too long.
