# Hunter Haugen

I am a long-time contributor to Vox Pupuli both on github and on irc. Probably most well-known for [puppet-hiera][hiera] and the fact that I am the [founder & longest running member][pr] of the Modules Team at Puppet itself. We also run a weekly community live [triage][triage]!

I have a few other projects in the puppet space that are also of interest:
- [A talk on roles & profiles pattern][rap] given at PuppetConf years ago; still relevant
- [puppetlabs-apache][apache] was rewritten by me (forgive me!)
- [puppetlabs-haproxy][haproxy] is another total rewrite that isn't so terrible
- [hunner-pry][pry] to run pry in puppet manifests
- [hunner-wordpress][wp] which was (is?) used for the official puppet trainings
- [progress_mq][pmq] which is a realtime puppet run progress monitor features in a PuppetConf keynote
- [Spacemacs][smacs] the worlds best editor; I contributed the puppet layer and use it daily

My pervasive involvement in the Puppet community and ecosystem makes me a good
candidate to join the PMC! Vote for me!
