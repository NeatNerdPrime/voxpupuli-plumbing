Hi,

I am Julien Pivotto, contributor to some VoxPupuli modules. In my portfolio you
can find [puppet-corosync][gvpc], which was given back to the community months
after [a call I made][cim].

I also participated in Puppet & Puppetlabs modules with several [Pull
Requests][pr].

I also give talks at Puppet Camps and other Open Source events regarding Puppet:
- [Paris 2016][p6] about Puppet-Corosync
- [Belgian Puppet User Group 09-2015][bpug1] about Puppet 4
- [FLOSS UK 2015][flossuk] about Puppet and Software Delivery
- [London 2014][l4] about Augeas
- [RMLL 2013][r3] about Testing

My deep involvement in the Puppet community and ecosystem makes me a good
candidate to join the PMC! Vote for me!
