# Dennis Hoppe

Hello, 

my name is Dennis Hoppe, also known as dhoppe. 

I am a self employed freelancer and like projects where I can work with AWS,
Puppet, Icinga 2, InfluxDB and Grafana. In my spare time I like to cook
Italian food and ride the bike. 

I am working with Puppet since version 0.25.4 and published my first modules
in 2011. Unfortunately I do not have enough time to maintain them. 

For that reason I like the idea of VoxPupuli, where several people take care
of the modules, and joined the team in 2015. 

I have worked a lot on the Kafka module and did some contributions to other
modules, fixing Puppet-Lint or Rubocop related issues. Basically I like to
solve problems and to improve the quality of modules.
